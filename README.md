# Go-Prototype
A T-shaped prototype of a travel bucket list task manager website called Go!

My task manager is a travel bucket list where users can manage destinations. The destinations they want to travel to and the destinations they have already been to. The task manager will also manage what users want to explore and see in destinations. I am a very keen traveller and I have had a lot of ideas about the places I want to visit throughout my lifetime. But, these dreams and ideas have often changed and I have had no way to keep track of them.  I believe this task manager would be very useful for myself and others like me who also want to travel but have no way to keep track of the places they want to explore. One day, I wish to expand on this prototype.
